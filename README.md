## 1. Introduction
In modern analog and mixed-signal integrated circuit design, a precise and stable voltage reference is one of the most critical building blocks. A voltage reference circuit is required to generate a DC output voltage that remains constant regardless of variations in temperature, supply voltage, and process parameters. Among the various techniques available for generating reference voltages, the bandgap voltage reference has become the industry standard due to its excellent stability characteristics derived from fundamental physical properties of semiconductor devices.

The bandgap voltage reference derives its name from the silicon bandgap energy of approximately 1.12 eV, which corresponds to a reference voltage near 1.2V at absolute zero. The principle behind the bandgap reference relies on combining two temperature-dependent voltages: the base-emitter voltage (VBE) of a bipolar junction transistor, which decreases with temperature (CTAT), and the thermal voltage (VT = kT/q), which increases with temperature (PTAT). When these two opposing temperature dependencies are properly summed with appropriate weighting, the result is a temperature-independent reference voltage close to the silicon bandgap voltage of approximately 1.2V.

A **Bandgap Reference (BGR)** circuit is an essential building block in analog and mixed-signal integrated circuits. Its main function is to generate a **stable reference voltage** that remains **independent of temperature, supply voltage, and process variations**. This stable voltage is used in many critical applications such as ADCs, DACs, voltage regulators, and biasing circuits.

The concept of the Bandgap Reference is based on combining two temperature-dependent voltages:

**CTAT (Complementary to Absolute Temperature) Voltage:**
* Typically derived from the base-emitter voltage (V<sub>BE</sub>) of a bipolar transistor.
* V<sub>BE</sub> decreases with increasing temperature (negative temperature coefficient).

<img width="825" height="295" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d27a9ba-6d6b-4963-82f8-c574f15db157" />

**PTAT (Proportional to Absolute Temperature) Voltage:**
* Generated from the difference in base-emitter voltages (ΔV<sub>BE</sub>) between two transistors operating at different current densities.
* ΔV<sub>BE</sub> increases with temperature (positive temperature coefficient).

<img width="328" height="627" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee122f26-e0ee-4478-83bf-1fd8fb7954ac" />

By carefully scaling and summing these two voltages, the opposing temperature effects cancel out, resulting in a **constant output voltage**—typically around **1.2 V**, which corresponds to the bandgap voltage of silicon at 0 K.

### 1.1 Working Principle (Simplified)
At its core, the Bandgap Reference circuit works as follows:
1. Generate a CTAT voltage from a diode-connected BJT (V<sub>BE</sub>).
2. Generate a PTAT voltage using two BJTs with different emitter area ratios.
3. Add the PTAT voltage (positive TC) to the CTAT voltage (negative TC) in proper proportions.
4. The resulting sum is a temperature-independent reference voltage.

### 1.2 Features of Bandgap Reference (BGR)
* Temperature-independent voltage reference circuit widely used in Integrated Circuits (ICs).
* Produces a constant output voltage regardless of power supply variation, temperature changes, and circuit loading.
* Typical output voltage is **≈ 1.2 V**, which is close to the bandgap energy of silicon at 0 K.
* Used in almost all types of circuits—analog, digital, mixed-signal, RF, and System-on-Chip (SoC) designs.

### 1.3 Literature work of BGR
The literature survey reveals that bandgap voltage reference design has evolved significantly over the past three decades, from the classical Widlar topology to modern sub-1V, nanopower implementations. The common thread across all designs is the exploitation of the PTAT and CTAT temperature characteristics of semiconductor devices to achieve a stable reference voltage
## 2. Tool and PDK Setup

### 2.1 Tools Setup
For the design, simulation, and verification of the BGR circuit, the following open-source EDA tools were utilized:

**Ngspice — Circuit Simulation**
Ngspice is an open-source SPICE-based simulator used for performing analog circuit simulations. It takes a SPICE netlist as input, which describes the circuit components and their connections, and then computes electrical parameters such as node voltages, currents, and transfer characteristics. 

In this project, Ngspice is used to simulate the schematic-level design of the BGR circuit, analyze DC, AC, and transient behavior, and verify temperature dependence and output voltage stability.

**Magic — Layout Design and DRC**
Magic is a VLSI layout editor developed by Berkeley, primarily used for IC layout design in open-source PDKs such as Sky130. It provides interactive tools for drawing transistors, interconnects, and layers according to process design rules.

Magic is used here to create the physical layout of the BGR circuit, perform Design Rule Checks (DRC), and extract the layout to generate a SPICE netlist for post-layout simulations.

bash
wget [http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/archive/magic-8.3.32.tgz](http://opencircuitdesign.com/magic/archive/magic-8.3.32.tgz)
tar xvfz magic-8.3.32.tgz
cd magic-8.3.32
./configure
sudo make
sudo make install

Netgen — LVS (Layout vs. Schematic)
Netgen is a layout verification tool used for Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) comparison. It compares the netlist extracted from the layout (using Magic) with the schematic netlist (used in Ngspice simulation) to verify connectivity and device matching. A successful LVS ensures that the layout accurately represents the schematic, confirming the design's electrical integrity before fabrication.

git clone git://[opencircuitdesign.com/netgen](https://opencircuitdesign.com/netgen)
cd netgen
./configure
sudo make
sudo make install

2.2 PDK Setup
The SkyWater sky130 PDK provides process design data (layers, device rules, models) required for layout, extraction, and simulation.

Steps for setup:

a) Create a directory for the PDK.

b) Clone the SkyWater PDK repository.

c) Initialize submodules (if required).

d) Build or install PDK libraries (optional).

e) Set the PDK path so tools like Magic, Ngspice, and Netgen can locate it easily.

### 3. The BGR Principle

3.1 Core Concepts:

The primary goal of a Bandgap Reference (BGR) circuit is to generate a robust reference voltage that remains completely independent of temperature fluctuations. It achieves this by combining two voltage components that react to temperature in perfectly opposite ways:

CTAT (Complementary to Absolute Temperature): A voltage that decreases as temperature increases. In silicon, the base-emitter voltage (V<sub>BE</sub>) of a forward-biased Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) or diode naturally exhibits this behavior, dropping at a rate of approximately -2 mV/°C.

PTAT (Proportional to Absolute Temperature): A voltage that increases as temperature increases. We can generate this by extracting the difference between the V<sub>BE</sub> of two transistors (ΔV<sub>BE</sub>) that are operating at different current densities.

⚙️ Principle of Operation
By carefully extracting the PTAT component and adding it to the CTAT component in a specific ratio, the upward and downward thermal slopes cancel each other out. The resulting sum is a constant, temperature-independent reference voltage of approximately 1.2 V—which corresponds to the bandgap energy of silicon at 0 K.

3.2 Types of Bandgap References:

BGR circuits can be categorized based on their underlying architecture and their specific application targets.

🧩 Architecture-wise Classification:

Self-Biased Current Mirror: Utilizes internal transistor feedback for biasing. It is highly favored for its simplicity, stability, and ease of integration into mixed-signal ICs.

Operational Amplifier-Based: Uses an op-amp to force precise node voltages. While it offers superior accuracy and matching, it consumes more power and area.

⚙️ Application-wise Classification:

Low-Voltage BGR: Designed to operate under constrained supply voltages.

Low-Power BGR: Optimized for battery-powered or energy-harvesting systems.

High-PSRR / Low-Noise BGR: Engineered to reject power supply ripples and minimize internal noise.

🧠 Our Design Choice:
For this project, I implemented a Self-Biased Current Mirror Architecture. This topology strikes an excellent balance between design simplicity, power efficiency, and reliable temperature stability without the overhead of an external operational amplifier.

3.3 Self-Biased Current Mirror Based BGR
This specific BGR architecture is constructed from several specialized sub-blocks that work together to maintain equilibrium and generate the 1.2 V reference.

🧩 Core Components:

CTAT Generator: Produces the downward-sloping thermal voltage (using a diode-connected BJT).

PTAT Generator: Produces the upward-sloping thermal voltage (using an array of matched BJTs and resistors).

Self-Biased Current Mirror (SBCM): A specialized current mirror that requires no external biasing. It uses internal feedback loops to automatically establish and stabilize its own operating current.

Reference Branch: The core summing node. A mirror transistor drives the PTAT current into a branch containing a resistor and a CTAT diode. The voltage drop across the resistor scales the PTAT slope to match the CTAT slope. The total voltage across this branch is our stable 1.2 V reference.

Start-up Circuit: A critical safety mechanism. Self-biased circuits inherently possess a "zero-current" degenerate state. The start-up circuit detects this dead state and injects a small initial current to kickstart the mirror, safely turning off once equilibrium is reached.

Advantages of this Topology:

a) Simplicity: A straightforward, amplifier-free structure that is easy to design and layout.

b) Inherent Stability: The internal self-biasing mechanism ensures a reliable operating point once active.

Limitations to Consider:

a) Lower PSRR: More susceptible to variations in the main power supply (cascoding is often required to fix this).

b) Voltage Headroom: Stacked transistors limit how low the main supply voltage can go.

c) Start-up Dependency: Absolutely requires a robust start-up circuit to prevent failure at power-on.

3.4  Bandgap Principle

The condition for temperature independence of VREF is obtained by setting the derivative of VREF with respect to temperature equal to zero:

dVREF/dT = dVBE/dT + α × (k/q) × ln(n) = 0     ... (3.5)

Since dVBE/dT ≈ −2 mV/°C and k/q = 86.17 µV/K, the coefficient α can be determined from the area ratio n and the desired cancellation. When the cancellation condition is satisfied, VREF converges to a value that extrapolates to the silicon bandgap energy at 0 Kelvin:

VREF ≈ Eg/q ≈ 1.12V    (extrapolated to 0K)     ... (3.6)

At room temperature (300K), the practical bandgap reference voltage is approximately 1.2V due to the residual temperature dependence of higher-order terms. This explains why the classic bandgap reference output voltage is ~1.2V, regardless of the technology node or supply voltage (within limits).

It should be noted that Equation (3.4) represents a first-order cancellation. In practice, VBE has a non-linear (higher-order) temperature dependence due to the temperature coefficient of IS. This results in a residual curvature in VREF versus temperature that requires additional compensation techniques (curvature correction) to reduce the TC below approximately 10 ppm/°C.

## 4. Design and Pre-layout Simulation
For the practical implementation of the BGR circuit, the SkyWater SKY130 (130 nm) PDK is used. Before designing the complete circuit, the specific design requirements must be calculated.

<img width="260" height="182" alt="{769D0A2F-B68E-4204-8F2F-B5A4FA718775}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57964431-6dba-4656-8156-bd216c2c1ed8" />
<img width="372" height="307" alt="{779F36D1-4EA9-46B0-95E2-8B12FA69E2CE}" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4938fc80-78bc-4750-a14b-430a5679c6db" />

4.1 Current Calculation
Maximum Power Consumption: 60 µW

Supply Voltage: 1.8 V

Total Current: 60 µW / 1.8 V = 33.33 µA

Branch Current: 10 µA per branch is selected (3 branches × 10 µA = 30 µA).

Start-up current: 1–2 µA.

4.2 Choosing Number of BJTs in Branch 2
Fewer BJTs lead to smaller resistance but poorer matching, while more BJTs lead to higher resistance but better matching.

Chosen compromise: 8 BJTs in parallel for good matching and moderate resistance.

4.3 Calculation of R1
Formula: R1 = (Vt × ln(8)) / I

Calculation: R1 = (26 mV × ln(8)) / 10.7 µA ≈ 5 kΩ

R1 Size: W = 1.41 µm, L = 7.8 µm (Unit resistance: 2 kΩ)

Resistor implementation: 2 in series and 2 in parallel (2 + 2 + (2‖2))

4.4 Calculation of R2
Current through reference branch: I3 = I2 = (Vt × ln(8)) / R1

Voltage across R2: VR2 = R2 × I3 = (R2 / R1) × (Vt × ln(8))

Slope of VR2: (R2 / R1) × (ln(8) × 115 µV/°C)

Slope of VQ3: -1.6 mV/°C

For a zero temperature coefficient, the total slope must equal 0.

Calculated R2: ≈ 33 kΩ

Resistor implementation: 16 in series and 2 in parallel (2 + 2 + … + 2 + (2‖2))

4.5 Self-Biased Current Mirror (SBCM) Design

Increase channel length to improve stability.

Final size: L = 1 µm, W = 5 µm, M = 8

## 5. CTAT Voltage Generation and Simulation
The first practical step in building the BGR is designing and verifying the CTAT (Complementary to Absolute Temperature) block. This block utilizes a diode-connected PNP Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) to generate a voltage that decreases linearly as temperature increases.

5.1 CTAT Circuit Netlist (ctat_voltage_gen.sp)
To generate the CTAT voltage, a single BJT (sky130_fd_pr__pnp_05v5_W3p40L3p40) is connected in a diode configuration (base and collector tied to ground). An ideal DC current source of 10uA is fed into the emitter.

A DC temperature sweep (.dc temp -40 125 5) is defined to simulate the voltage response across the BJT from -40°C to 125°C.

![CTAT Netlist]

5.2 Troubleshooting Sky130 PDK Errors
During the initial simulation attempt using Ngspice-45+, a fatal error occurred preventing the simulation from running.

The Error:
The simulator crashed with: Error: Could not find include file ../../../cells/rf_nfet_01v8/sky130_fd_pr__rf_nfet_01v8_b__tt.corner.spice.
This happens because the open-source Sky130 library sometimes contains broken relative paths to RF components that are not required for this basic analog design.

<img width="1024" height="674" alt="image" src="https://github.com/abdulraheem-tech/BGR-Skywater130nm-PDK/blob/7a2c5259a81f463e6f2783049e1225a53d06295f/fwdprelayoutandpostlayout/25.png" />

### The Fix:
Instead of manually hunting down the broken file, I used a Linux stream editor (sed) command to automatically find the broken .include line inside the tt corner file and comment it out (adding an asterisk * at the beginning of the line).
sed -i '/\.include/s/^/* /' /home/vsduser/cad_vsd/eda-technology/sky130/models/spice/models/corners/tt/rf.spice
After patching the library file, the simulation compiled and ran successfully.

5.3 CTAT Simulation Results
Plotting the emitter voltage v(qp1) against the temperature sweep yields the expected CTAT behavior. As seen in the graph below, the voltage starts high at lower temperatures (around 850 mV at -40°C) and drops linearly as the temperature increases to 125°C.

5.4 Temperature Coefficient (Slope) Verification
To verify the exact temperature coefficient, we measured the slope of the V<sub>BE</sub> curve (dy/dx). I also expanded the simulation to test a multiple-BJT configuration (ctat_voltage_gen_mult_bjt.sp) to observe how parallel devices behave.

Using Ngspice's interactive measurement tools, the slope of the curve was calculated as:

dy/dx = -0.00173136 V/°C

Temperature Coefficient ≈ -1.73 mV/°C

This aligns with the theoretical expectation of approximately -2 mV/°C, confirming that the CTAT block is functioning correctly and is ready to be integrated into the main Bandgap Reference circuit.

<img width="1024" height="542" alt="image" src="https://github.com/abdulraheem-tech/BGR-Skywater130nm-PDK/blob/ef2dcd1e32bef539fcd702b18f6f9b961b5ba030/fwdprelayoutandpostlayout/7.png" />

5.5 CTAT Voltage under Variable Bias Current
To further understand the behavior of the CTAT block, it is important to observe how the base-emitter voltage (V<sub>BE</sub>) changes under different biasing conditions. The V<sub>BE</sub> of a BJT is logarithmically dependent on its collector/emitter current.

What I Did:
I created a copy of the original CTAT netlist (ctat_voltage_gen_var_current.sp) and modified the .dc control statement to perform a nested parametric sweep. Instead of simulating just one fixed 10 µA current, the simulator sweeps the temperature from -40°C to +125°C while simultaneously stepping the bias current through multiple values.

Simulation Results & Graph Analysis:
Plotting the emitter voltage v(qp1) under these conditions yields a "family of curves." Each individual red line represents the CTAT voltage drop across the BJT at a specific, fixed bias current.

Vertical Shift: As the bias current increases, the entire CTAT line shifts upward (resulting in a higher overall V<sub>BE</sub>).

Slope Variation: The terminal output shows slope calculations (dy/dx) for different curves (e.g., -1.92 mV/°C, -1.74 mV/°C). This demonstrates that changing the bias current slightly alters the Temperature Coefficient (TC) of the diode.

<img width="1024" height="432" alt="image" src="https://github.com/abdulraheem-tech/BGR-Skywater130nm-PDK/blob/ef2dcd1e32bef539fcd702b18f6f9b961b5ba030/fwdprelayoutandpostlayout/5.png" />

### 6. PTAT Voltage Generation and Simulation
With the CTAT block verified, the next step is generating the PTAT (Proportional to Absolute Temperature) voltage. This voltage must increase with temperature to successfully cancel out the CTAT's negative slope.

A PTAT voltage is generated by extracting the difference in base-emitter voltages (ΔV<sub>BE</sub>) between two BJTs operating at different current densities. To achieve this, the circuit uses one BJT in the first branch and eight identical BJTs connected in parallel in the second branch.

6.1 Initial Simulation and Ammeter Errors
During the initial attempt to measure the branch currents, Ngspice threw a no such vector vid1#branch fatal error.

### The Fix:
In SPICE simulators, measuring current directly through a wire is not natively supported. To plot current, you must insert a "dummy" 0-volt DC voltage source in series with the branch to act as a physical ammeter. I modified the netlist to include vid1 and vid2 (0V sources) to successfully extract the current data.

6.2 The Flatline Current Issue
After fixing the ammeter error, plotting the current resulted in a perfectly flat horizontal line at 10 µA across all temperatures.

The Cause: The preliminary netlist used ideal, fixed DC current sources (isup1 node1 qp1 dc 10u). An ideal source will force exactly 10 µA regardless of temperature, which prevents the natural PTAT slope from forming.

6.3 Behavioral Source Implementation & Debugging
To generate a true PTAT current without prematurely introducing the complex PMOS current mirror, I replaced the ideal current sources with Behavioral Current Sources (B-sources). This allows the simulator to dynamically calculate the current based on the voltage difference between the two BJT branches.

### The Syntax Bug:
My initial B-source equation was: I=(v(qp1)-v(qp2))/4890 + 0.1u. However, the simulator produced a flat graph at near absolute zero (measured in femtoamps fA). This occurred because the strict mathematical engine inside Ngspice's B-source does not recognize the u (micro) suffix, treating the startup current as zero and preventing the BJTs from turning on.

### The Fix:
I corrected the syntax using strict scientific notation, providing a 1 nanoamp "spark" to initiate the self-biasing loop:
B1 node1 qp1 I='(v(qp1)-v(qp2))/4890 + 1e-9'
B2 node2 qp2 I='(v(qp1)-v(qp2))/4890 + 1e-9'

6.4 Final PTAT Current Verification
With the behavioral sources correctly implemented, the simulation successfully generated the PTAT current. As shown below, the current through both branches perfectly overlaps and slopes upwards linearly as temperature increases, crossing ~10 µA at 0°C.

6.5 Final PTAT Voltage Verification
The ultimate goal of this block is the ΔV<sub>BE</sub> voltage. To verify this, I plotted three vectors:

v(ra1): The voltage across the single BJT branch (Blue line).

v(qp2): The voltage across the 8-parallel BJT branch (Red line).

v(ra1) - v(qp2): The difference between them (Yellow line).

The resulting graph perfectly demonstrates the PTAT principle. While the individual BJT voltages drop with temperature (CTAT behavior), the difference between them (the yellow line) starts low and slopes upwards, providing the exact positive temperature coefficient needed for the final Bandgap Reference.

<img width="1024" height="528" alt="image" src="https://github.com/abdulraheem-tech/BGR-Skywater130nm-PDK/blob/ef2dcd1e32bef539fcd702b18f6f9b961b5ba030/fwdprelayoutandpostlayout/10.png" />


### 7. Ideal Op-Amp Based Bandgap Reference Simulation
After successfully isolating and verifying both the CTAT and PTAT behaviors, the next step is to combine them into a complete Bandgap Reference (BGR) circuit. Before implementing a complex, transistor-level operational amplifier, it is standard practice to first simulate the BGR core using an Ideal Op-Amp (modeled as a Voltage-Controlled Voltage Source, or VCVS).

7.1 Circuit Architecture
The circuit uses a VCVS with a high gain (1000) to enforce equal voltages at the top of the CTAT and PTAT branches. PMOS transistors (xmp1, xmp2, xmp3) act as a current mirror, ensuring identical current flows through all three branches.

Branch 1 (CTAT): A single BJT (Q1).

Branch 2 (PTAT): A resistor (R1) and 8 parallel BJTs (Q2).

Branch 3 (Reference): A scaling resistor (R2) and a single BJT (Q3). The voltage at the top of this branch is our final Vref.

7.2 Resolving Ngspice-45+ Compatibility and Convergence Issues
During the initial simulation runs, two major SPICE errors occurred which required netlist modifications to ensure successful compilation.

7.2.1. The "Too Few Parameters" Error:
The simulation halted immediately with a parameter error targeting the xqp (BJT) instances.

## Cause: Newer, stricter versions of Ngspice (v45+) reject the m= (multiplier) shortcut for the Sky130 BJT subcircuits, as the model explicitly expects a fixed number of terminal nodes.

## Solution: To maintain exact electrical equivalence with the instructor's design, I replaced the m=8 parameter by explicitly instantiating 8 individual Sky130 BJT models connected in parallel.

7.2.2. The "Singular Matrix" Convergence Error:
After fixing the BJT parameters, the simulator threw a Singular matrix: check node vref error and failed to compute the DC sweep.

Cause: An ideal VCVS has infinite bandwidth and no supply limits. When a DC sweep begins at extremely low temperatures (e.g., -40°C or 0°C), initial node voltages are zero. The ideal op-amp responds with an infinite impulse, causing the mathematical matrix to become singular (divide-by-zero) and crash. Furthermore, unassigned dummy nodes (like a typo of ref instead of vref in the plot command) can leave nodes floating.

Solution: I ensured all dummy ammeters (vid1, vid2, vid3) were correctly wired to provide a path to ground. To assist the SPICE convergence engine, the DC sweep was adjusted to begin at a stable room temperature (.dc temp 27 125 5), allowing the matrix to calculate the initial steady-state operating point successfully.

7.3 Internal Node Verification
Before checking the final output, I verified that the internal feedback loops were operating correctly.

Op-Amp Voltage Tracking:
By plotting v(qp1) and v(ra1), we can confirm that the VCVS is successfully forcing the two branch voltages to be identical. The graph shows the two lines perfectly overlapping, proving the op-amp is maintaining the virtual short.

<img width="584" height="510" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d43f3498-ae51-4a6d-9e09-cf759e310a22" />


PTAT Current Generation:
By plotting the current through the dummy ammeters (vid1#branch and vid2#branch), the graph confirms that the PMOS current mirrors and the BJT ΔV<sub>BE</sub> are successfully generating a PTAT current that slopes linearly upwards.

<img width="1600" height="899" alt="image" src="https://github.com/abdulraheem-tech/BGR-Skywater130nm-PDK/blob/7a2c5259a81f463e6f2783049e1225a53d06295f/fwdprelayoutandpostlayout/18.png" />

7.4 Final Bandgap Voltage Verification
With the internal mechanics verified, I plotted the final reference voltage.

The BGR Parabola:
Plotting v(vref) yields the classic "Bandgap Parabola." Because the CTAT and PTAT slopes are not perfectly linear across all extremes of temperature, their sum creates a slight curvature. The voltage remains incredibly stable, peaking precisely around 1.237 V, confirming a highly stable reference.

<img width="1024" height="567" alt="image" src="https://github.com/abdulraheem-tech/BGR-Skywater130nm-PDK/blob/7a2c5259a81f463e6f2783049e1225a53d06295f/fwdprelayoutandpostlayout/2.png" />

The Component Breakdown (The "Holy Grail" Plot):
To visually demonstrate the core principle of the Bandgap Reference, I plotted the constituent voltages on a single graph:

Blue Line v(qp3): The CTAT voltage component, decreasing with temperature.

Red Line v(vref) - v(qp3): The scaled PTAT voltage across the resistor, increasing with temperature.

Orange Line v(vref): The sum of the Red and Blue lines. The opposing slopes perfectly cancel out, resulting in the flat, stable 1.23 V reference.

<img width="553" height="436" alt="image" src="https://github.com/abdulraheem-tech/BGR-Skywater130nm-PDK/blob/7a2c5259a81f463e6f2783049e1225a53d06295f/fwdprelayoutandpostlayout/3.png" />

This successfully completes the verification of the Ideal Op-Amp BGR topology. The next stage involves replacing the ideal VCVS with a real, transistor-level Self-Biased Current Mirror.

7.5 Simulation Migration & Debugging: Complete BGR Circuit (Sky130)
This specifically addresses compatibility issues encountered when migrating from ngspice 33 to ngspice 45+ for the complete BGR schematic.

<img width="1024" height="654" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/244fed4d-2272-45f3-9e21-e493a235fde8" />

7.5.1 The BJT Subcircuit Instantiation Error
The Symptom:
When running the initial .sp netlist on ngspice 45+, the simulation halted immediately with the following fatal error:

Too few parameters for subcircuit type "sky130_fd_pr__pnp_05v5_w3p40l3p40" (instance: xxqp1)
Simulation interrupted due to error!

### The Root Cause:
This issue stems from stricter syntax enforcement in newer versions of ngspice, combined with how the Skywater 130nm BJT models are defined.

In the schematic, the BJT transistors (Q1, Q2, Q3) are diode-connected vertical PNPs.

The original netlist instantiated these devices using three nodes (Collector, Base, Emitter).

However, the standard .subckt definition for this specific Skywater device expects four terminals. The fourth terminal represents the local p-substrate (bulk), which must be explicitly defined in ngspice 45+.

### The Fix:
We modified the BJT definitions in the netlist to include the fourth terminal. Since these are p-substrate devices, the bulk terminal is tied to ground.

Original Code (ngspice 33 compatibility):
xqp1  gnd  gnd  qp1       sky130_fd_pr__pnp_05v5_W3p40L3p40       m=1
xqp2  gnd  gnd  qp2       sky130_fd_pr__pnp_05v5_W3p40L3p40       m=8
xqp3  gnd  gnd  qp3       sky130_fd_pr__pnp_05v5_W3p40L3p40       m=1

Updated Code (ngspice 45+ compatibility):

xqp1  gnd  gnd  qp1  gnd  sky130_fd_pr__pnp_05v5_W3p40L3p40       m=1
xqp2  gnd  gnd  qp2  gnd  sky130_fd_pr__pnp_05v5_W3p40L3p40       m=8
xqp3  gnd  gnd  qp3  gnd  sky130_fd_pr__pnp_05v5_W3p40L3p40       m=1


7.5.2 The Cascading Plot Error
### The Symptom:
Following the BJT error, the terminal outputted a secondary error during the .control block execution:

### Error: no such vector vdd in term: v(vdd)

### The Root Cause:
This was a cascading "ghost" error caused by the first failure. Because ngspice interrupted the simulation due to the missing BJT parameter, the transient analysis (.tran) never executed. Consequently, no voltage vectors (like VDD or VREF) were written to the simulation memory. When the script reached the plot command, it couldn't find the data.

### The Fix:
No direct fix was needed for the .control block. Resolving the BJT subcircuit instantiation allowed the simulation to complete, successfully generating the vectors required for plotting.

7.5.3 Final Verification and Results
With the netlist corrected, ngspice 45+ successfully executed the simulation in the Ubuntu environment, yielding two key verification plots:

Transient Start-up Response: The simulation confirmed the start-up circuit (comprising MP4, MP5, and MN3) successfully pulled the system out of the zero-current degenerate state. The supply voltage (VDD) ramped up, and the internal nodes (like net1 and net2) settled to their expected steady-state DC operating points, pulling VREF to its stable reference value.

Temperature Sweep (DC Analysis): The parabolic "bow" curve of VREF vs. Temperature (from -40°C to 120°C) was successfully plotted. This validates that the Proportional to Absolute Temperature (PTAT) and Complementary to Absolute Temperature (CTAT) currents are correctly summing to provide a temperature-independent reference voltage near the center of our operating range.

### 8. Physical Implementation: Top-Level BGR Layout
Objective: To document the physical layout of the complete Bandgap Reference circuit using the Skywater 130nm PDK. The layout employs a modular, mismatch-resilient approach to ensure accurate PTAT/CTAT current generation across process and temperature variations.

8.1 Modular Analog Layout Strategy
To guarantee high precision and minimize process variations—which are critical for an accurate reference voltage circuit—the layout was partitioned into individual sub-blocks (PMOS, NMOS, Resistors, and BJTs). This modular approach allows for optimized matching techniques within each specific device type before the final top-level integration.

8.2 Transistor Arrays (PMOS & NMOS)
The current mirrors (forming the core of the SBCM and startup circuit) rely heavily on exact current replication.

Multi-finger Layout: The PMOS and NMOS devices were instantiated as multi-finger arrays. This technique reduces gate resistance and parasitic junction capacitance, improving the overall response time.

Dummy Devices: Dummy transistors were strategically placed at the boundaries of the arrays. These inactive devices protect the critical inner transistors from lithographic and etching variations (edge effects) during fabrication, ensuring the active devices match perfectly.

8.3 High-Poly Resistor Bank
The reference branch and PTAT generation rely on the exact ratio of the resistors (R1 and R2), rather than their absolute values.

The resistors were laid out as a centralized bank using high-poly resistive layers.

By grouping them closely together, they experience identical thermal gradients and doping concentrations. This ensures that even if the absolute resistance drifts with temperature or process shifts, their relative ratio remains constant.

8.4 BJT Array (Common Centroid)
The BJT array is the heart of the temperature-sensing mechanism, responsible for creating the exact 1:8 current density ratio between Q1 and Q2.

Common Centroid Matching: To combat thermal gradients and process variations across the silicon die, the BJTs are arranged in a highly symmetric grid.

The single 1x BJT (Q1) is placed exactly in the center, perfectly surrounded by the eight 1x BJTs that make up Q2.

A protective ring of dummy BJTs encapsulates the active 3x3 array to ensure uniform etching and prevent boundary mismatches from ruining the 1:8 ratio.

8.5 Top-Level Integration & Routing
The final top-level layout integrates all the precision-matched sub-blocks.

The blocks are arranged to minimize the routing distance of sensitive analog nodes (like net1 and net2) to reduce parasitic resistance and capacitance.

The layout successfully passed Design Rule Checks (DRC) in the Magic VLSI tool, ensuring strict manufacturability compliance with the Sky130 process node.
